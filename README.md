# Practicum Projects
Each of these projects are for the Machine Learning portion of the Practicum Data Science course. The course is structed as a sprint, one week of learning and one week of making a project to test and show knowledge of the subject just taught. For now, some of the code for old projects have been improved, and some of them aren't. Generally, older projects are less indicitive of my current coding skills =)
