After simplifying the purpose reasons into four it categories drops much more rows and turning each column with string values into lowercase, drop_duplicates() droped a noticable amount of rows. In the education column there was three different strings for what was basically just one. For example, for 'some college', there was also a version with just the first letter capitalized (Some college) and also a version with it all capitalized (SOME COLLEGE).

Each risk check will be a conversion to see which category is more likely to be a risk of late payment on a loan, except for kids and debt rate, which will be a pivot table. For total income and debt, I used the median of all incomes given to find the break point for what will be considered those with a higher income level and those with a lower level. I chose the median as it will prevent the baseline from being affected too heavily by abnormally high or low income levels. This will give a general idea of if higher income will help or hurt when deciding credit for a loan.\n",

The reason being that there are too little loaners with those amount of children to make any good conclusion out of, compared to the rest of the data. If I were to allowed those three, it may skew the conclusion as since there are fewer values it likely would vary significantly where it otherwise shouldn't."

While only increasing about 2% in total from having 0 children to 1, this is close to about a 25% increase in rate compared to the jump from 7% to 9%. The rate increases slightly for those that have 2 kids and then drops back down to 8% for those that have 3 kids, which is still a noticably higher rate than those without. It is likely the case that having to pay for children would make paying back a loan harder as the kids themselves take money away from what could have been a loan repayment."

Education may be lower because it is essentially able to pay for itself with the future career granted by it. Car purchases may also be less risky for a default compared to housing as cars are much cheaper than housing while also a necessity.

    "Using the dataset and analyzing the data, a good idea for both a perfect and risky candidate for a loan can be determined. Overall, those with children is significantly safer of a risk for a loan than those who have none. This can be explained for the co-dependant relationship those with children likely have with the other parent, but this is disproven as someone who is married is also much more likely to default, whereas those with a civil partnership or those not married are almost twice as safe. This may lead to the possibility that unmarried couples with children are a safer loan, but more data may be needed to support that conclusion. According to the data income level makes little impact on the rate of late payment, with those under and above the median having a nearly indentical rate. Loan purpose may be the best determination for risk as those who use it for a housing purchase are much more risky, with those using it for a car purchase following behind in risk but almost twice as safe than a housing loan, with education and marriage being the safest purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal person according to the data would be unmarried with children using the loan for marriage. This may be that those that are newly married are much more likely to stay together and rely on each other, both of which are likely to be contributing to paying back the loan as they both use it, and their co-dependance may also be a factor for ensuring the loan is sucessfully paid back on time. Individuals that are already married may also be co-dependant but the loan purpose may be more personal in nature rather than for the benefit of both, so it may only be the primary loan taker paying it instead of both and they may have progressed independance financially compared to newly weds, which may explain why already married couples are risky comparatively."
